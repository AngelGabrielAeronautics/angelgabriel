# Bug Fixes Report - Angel Gabriel Aeronautics

This report documents 3 bugs found and fixed in the Angel Gabriel Aeronautics codebase.

## Bug 1: Missing Key Prop in Nested Map Operation

### Location
`/app/fleet/page.tsx` - Line 451

### Description
The nested map operation rendering aircraft specifications was missing a unique key prop. While the outer map (rendering aircraft) had a key prop using the index, the inner map (rendering specs) only used `specIndex`, which could lead to React reconciliation issues when the same spec index appears across different aircraft.

### Impact
- **Performance**: React may unnecessarily re-render components due to improper key identification
- **UI Bugs**: Potential incorrect DOM updates when aircraft list changes
- **Warning**: React development mode would show key prop warnings

### Fix
Changed from:
```tsx
<div key={specIndex}>{spec}</div>
```

To:
```tsx
<div key={`${aircraft.name}-spec-${specIndex}`}>{spec}</div>
```

This ensures each spec has a globally unique key by combining the aircraft name with the spec index.

## Bug 2: Race Condition in AnimatedServiceCollage Component

### Location
`/app/components/AnimatedServiceCollage.tsx` - Lines 49-64

### Description
The component uses `setInterval` to periodically update the displayed images, but the cleanup function only clears the interval. This could lead to a race condition where the interval callback executes after the component unmounts, attempting to update state on an unmounted component.

### Impact
- **Memory Leak**: Potential memory leak from state updates on unmounted components
- **Console Errors**: React would log errors about updating state on unmounted components
- **Performance**: Unnecessary computations after component unmount

### Fix
Added a `mounted` flag to prevent state updates after unmount:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  let mounted = true;
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    if (!mounted) return;
    setIndices(prev => {
      // ... existing logic
    });
  }, 2000);
  return () => {
    mounted = false;
    clearInterval(interval);
  };
}, []);
```

## Bug 3: XSS Vulnerability in Error Message Display

### Location
`/app/components/QuoteRequestForm.tsx` - Line 195

### Description
Server error messages were being directly interpolated into toast notifications without sanitization. If the server returns malicious content (e.g., through a compromised API or man-in-the-middle attack), it could execute arbitrary JavaScript.

### Impact
- **Security**: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **User Data**: Malicious scripts could steal user data or perform unauthorized actions
- **Trust**: Could compromise user trust if exploited

### Fix
Added basic sanitization to remove potential HTML tags:

```tsx
// Before:
toast.error(`Error submitting form: ${errMsg}`);

// After:
const sanitizedError = String(errMsg).replace(/[<>]/g, '');
toast.error(`Error submitting form: ${sanitizedError}`);
```

This removes angle brackets that could be used to inject HTML/script tags while preserving the error message content.

## Recommendations

1. **Key Props**: Consider implementing a linting rule to catch missing key props in map operations
2. **Component Lifecycle**: Use React's `useRef` hook or libraries like `use-unmounted` for more robust unmount detection
3. **Security**: Implement a comprehensive input sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) for all user-facing content
4. **Code Review**: Establish security-focused code review practices to catch vulnerabilities early
5. **Testing**: Add unit tests for these specific scenarios to prevent regression

## Summary

All three bugs have been successfully fixed:
- ✅ React performance issue with missing key props
- ✅ Memory leak from race condition in animated component
- ✅ XSS vulnerability in error message handling

The fixes are minimal and focused, ensuring they don't introduce new issues while addressing the core problems.
